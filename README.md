### The Selection Problem

The purpose of this program is to implement two different algorithms to solve the famous selection problem. Selection1 simply sorts the elements in decreasing order and returns the kth value. Selection2 divides the array in half, sorts the first half, then swaps out elements larger than k before returning the value for k.

</br>

### Binary Recursion

The purpose of this code is to recursively find, and then display the binary representation of a number.

</br>

### Doubly Linked Lists

 Data Structures and Algorithms
 The purpose of this homework assignment is to implement and test different methods
 that can be used to navigate a double linked list. Methods such as append, insert, isEmpty,
 currPos are amongst the many methods that will be implemented and tested.

</br>

### Sorting Doubly Linked Lists

The following program will take a double linked list and sort its contents. After sorting the contents of the double linked list a remove methods is implemented that removes any duplicate values amongst the double linked list.

### Binary Search Tree Methods

The purpose of this assignment is to implement new methods for a binary search tree class. The first method counts the number of leaf nodes in the tree. The second calculates the height of the tree, and the third method calculates the depth of a particular node.

</br>

### AVL Tree Rotations


The purpose of this program is to simulate the rotations of a AVL tree.
</br>

### The Selection Problem Using Binary Heaps

Similar to Homework one, this program consists of two different ways to solve the famous selection problem. Unlike Homework One, we will be solving this using a priority queue and recording the time it took.
</br>

### The Complexity of Sorting Algorithms

The purpose of this program is to run different sorting algorithms on arrays of different sizes. We are able to time each one of these algorithms and determine their overall speed.
