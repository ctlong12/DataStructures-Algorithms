### The Selection Problem

The purpose of this program is to implement two different algorithms to solve the famous selection problem. Selection1 simply sorts the elements in decreasing order and returns the kth value. Selection2 divides the array in half, sorts the first half, then swaps out elements larger than k before returning the value for k.

</br>

### Binary Recursion

The purpose of this code is to recursively find and display the binary representation of a number.

</br>

### Doubly Linked Lists

 The purpose of this assignment is to implement and test different method. These methods
 can be used to navigate a doubly linked list. Methods such as append, insert, isEmpty,
 current position are just a few of many methods that will be implemented and tested.

</br>

### Sorting Doubly Linked Lists

The following program will take a doubly linked list and sort its contents. After sorting the contents of the double linked list a remove methods is implemented that removes any duplicate values in the double linked list.


</br>

### Binary Search Tree Methods

The purpose of this assignment is to implement new methods for a binary search tree class. The first method counts the number of leaf nodes in the tree. The second calculates the height of the tree, and the third method calculates the depth of a particular node.

</br>

### AVL Tree Rotations

The purpose of this program is to write the methods to perform rotations on a AVL tree.

</br>

### The Selection Problem Using Binary Heaps

Similar to the first assignment, this program consists of two ways to solve the famous selection problem. Unlike Homework One, we will be solving this using a priority queue and recording the time it took.

</br>

### The Complexity of Sorting Algorithms

The purpose of this program is to run different sorting algorithms on arrays of all different sizes. We are able to time each one of these algorithms and determine their overall speed. We draw conclusions about their complexity based on a their graph.


### Min-Max Heap

A min-max heap is a complete binary tree data structure which combines the usefulness of both a min-heap and a max-heap, that is, it provides constant time retrieval and logarithmic time removal of both the minimum and maximum elements in it. This makes the min-max heap a very useful data structure to implement a double-ended priority queue.
